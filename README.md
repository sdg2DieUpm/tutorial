# Tutorial 3: combined FSM in C project files

This tutorial is the third of a series of three tutorials that will guide you through the process of creating a Finite State Machine (FSM) in C for the MatrixMCU toolkit. In this tutorial, you will learn how to create a combined FSM in C. 

> :warning: This repository contains some files for the tutorial only. **You must download the first tutorial ([tutorial_1](https://github.com/sdg2DieUpm/tutorial/tree/tutorial_1)) and complete both tutorials `tutorial_1` and `tutorial_2` before continuing with this one.**

## Getting Started

Copy the project `tutorial_2` folder into a new folder called `tutorial_3`.

Download the files of this repository and copy them into the corresponding folders of the `tutorial_3` project:

- `fsm_button.c` into `common/src/`
- `fsm_button.h` into `common/include/`
- `port_button.c` into `port/stm32f4/src/`
- `port_button.h` into `port/stm32f4/include/`

### Prerequisites

Be sure that you fulfill the prerequisites of the MatrixMCU toolkit and it is up to date and **complete the previous tutorials ([tutorial_1](https://github.com/sdg2DieUpm/tutorial/tree/tutorial_1) and [tutorial_2](https://github.com/sdg2DieUpm/tutorial/tree/tutorial_2))**.
