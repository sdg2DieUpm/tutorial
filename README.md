# Tutorial 2: introduction to FSM in C project files

This tutorial is the second of a series of tutorials that will guide you through the process of creating a Finite State Machine (FSM) in C for the MatrixMCU toolkit. In this tutorial, we will create a simple FSM that will control the blinking of the LEDs of the MatrixMCU board.

> :warning: This repository contains some files for the tutorial only. **You must download and complete the previous tutorial ([tutorial_1](https://github.com/sdg2DieUpm/tutorial/tree/tutorial_1)) before starting with this one**.

## Getting Started

Copy the project `tutorial_1` folder into a new folder called `tutorial_2`.

Download the files of this repository and copy them into the corresponding folders of the `tutorial_2` project:

- `fsm_blink.c` into `common/src/`
- `fsm_blink.h` into `common/include/`

### Prerequisites

Be sure that you fulfill the prerequisites of the MatrixMCU toolkit and it is up to date and **complete the previous tutorial ([tutorial_1](https://github.com/sdg2DieUpm/tutorial/tree/tutorial_1)).**
